The single-player campaign has been estimated to contain around seven hours of game play and supports four-player online co-op, both in the campaign and in a new survival mode called firefight.&nbsp;All the original <i>Halo 3</i> multiplayer maps and DLC packages through Mythic are included on the second disc, along with three new maps that will launch with <i>ODST</i>. Full integration between <i>Halo 3</i> and <i>Halo 3: ODST</i> online is available, with the exception of the <i>ODST</i>-exclusive maps, which may or may not be made available as downloads at some point in the future.<br /><br /> <h2>Overview</h2> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1056734\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3507/1056734-954261_20090531_screen020_super.jpg\" title=\"The new protagonist, known as 'The Rookie'.\"><img id=\"1056734\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3507/1056734-954261_20090531_screen020_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The new protagonist, known as 'The Rookie'.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption p-4\">The new protagonist, known as 'The Rookie'.</div></div></div></div><i>Halo 3: ODST</i> does not feature <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/master-chief/94-175/\">                                         Master Chief</a> as past installments of halo games have.

However, the city's municipal AI, the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/superintendent/94-11142/\">                                         Superintendent</a>, looks to provide aid to the ODSTs in their fight, via manipulation of electronic billboards and other methods.<br /><br />The game's multiplayer component is identical to Halo 3's, with the exception of the new Firefight mode and three&nbsp;<i>ODST</i>-exclusive maps. The game will sell for $60, a $100 edition will have a Halo-themed controller. The game does have a lower RRP of \u00a340 in the UK, as opposed to the normal RRP of \u00a350.<br /><br /> <h2>Story</h2> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"723127\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-screen\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/118/723127-h3recon4_super.jpg\" title=\"Mombasa destroyed\"><img id=\"723127\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/118/723127-h3recon4_screen.jpg\" alt=\"Mombasa destroyed\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption p-4\">Mombasa destroyed</div></div></div></div>In the ending cut scene for \"Metropolis,\" the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/prophet-of-regret/94-1299/\">                                         Prophet of Regret</a> performs a slipspace jump inside the city of New Mombasa, almost destroying it. The trailer for <i>Halo 3: ODST</i> shows this explosion affecting massive numbers of orbital drop pods, including the one containing the Rookie. The Rookie's pod crashes into a dark alley, knocking him unconscious for six hours. Covenant forces arrive in the area, but the Rookie wakes up and avoids detection. He observes the Covenant presence, loads a silenced variant of the series' traditional <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/m7-smg/93-126/\">                                         submachine gun</a>, and begins to leave the area. A nearby sign flashes a message from the Superintendent, New Mombasa's municipal AI, showing the Rookie which direction to take and advising him to proceed with caution.<br /><br />Because of the tremendously hard landing of his pod (the Superintendent, watching through municipal surveillance cameras, estimates a 99.99% chance of fatality), the Rookie remains unconscious for six hours after the initial drop; while he is passed out in his drop pod, the rest of his squad is out fighting the alien invaders in the city. The Rookie wakes up at night, and sets out in search of his lost squad mates in New Mombasa. Whenever the Rookie discovers a \"beacon\", an object related to a specific squad member, a playable flashback occurs, which will detail the story that happened while the Rookie was out of action.<br /><br />&nbsp;The Superintendent serves as your guide and AI companion through the campaign, but in a far more passive way than <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/cortana/94-315/\">                                         Cortana</a> has appeared in past Halo games.<br /><br /> <h2>The Squad<br /></h2> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1043433\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/5150/1043433-newhero_super.jpg\" title=\"The gang's all here.\"><img id=\"1043433\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/5150/1043433-newhero_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The gang's all here.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption p-4\">The gang's all here.</div></div></div></div>The player is a member of a 6-man ODST squad, dropped on New Mombasa right before Regret's carrier jumps to slipspace. The player's character, the Rookie, will be attempting to discover what happened to his teammates after their drop went wrong. Four times throughout the game, the Rookie will discover objects that hint as to what his teammates have done. Whenever one of these objects is encountered, a playable flashback occurs, with the player taking the role of another man in the squad, for a thirty-minute or so scene detailing what happened to that particular squad-member. The December Game Informer issue detailed two of these characters, and gave the names of the other two. Bungie has also released an article on its forums entitled <a href=\"http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&amp;link=Halo3ODSTsquad\" rel=\"nofollow\">                                         Meet the Squad</a> which gives a more personalized run down of the squad members and the character you play. <br />&nbsp;<br /> <h3><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/the-rookie/94-11077/\"> <b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b></a><b><u><a> </a></u><a>                                    The Rookie</a></b></h3>&nbsp;The Rookie is the silent protagonist of Halo 3: ODST.&nbsp; Little is known of the rookie, all the player knows is that he is newcomer to the squad and everything that precedes after that that.&nbsp; The rookie is knocked unconscious for six hours after his drop and seems to to be the only human left in the city.&nbsp; The rookie moves around the city looking for clues of his lost squad mates and learns of their fate through the eyes of the Superintendent.&nbsp; <br /><br /> <h3><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/dare/94-10969/\"> <b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b> </b><b>Dare</b></a> <br /></h3>Captain Dare is the only female member of the mission, and wears Recon armor as opposed to standard ODST gear.

Behind the death\u2019s head rictus, jolly roger, and layer upon layer of black and gray armor is a man of deep spiritual convictions and respect for those he serves alongside.

Romeo believes his true vocation is to be a ladies\u2019 man. But just because he\u2019s a lover doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t be a fighter\u2014and a damned fine one at that. He keeps his gear clean, his suit looking sharp, and his body lean and strong.

The game sets the players in a partially open city with the goal of finding and investigating the last known locations of your four ODST squad mates and fighting off the Covenant forces in the area. Once you reach one of the last-known waypoints of your four teammates you will find an object related to your teammates or evidence of their presence--such as a sniper rifle hanging from a street light--and enter a <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/flashback/92-226/\">                                         flashback</a> to earlier that day, where you'll control the squad member for an entire level. Through the 30 minute flashback, which is said to play more like a traditional, linear, Halo level, you will discover the fate of your teammate and unravel the mystery of the events that occured in New Mombasa. The game will continue after you activate all four waypoints, but how it will progress is unknown. The New Mombasa \"open world\" is comparable in function to the hub world from a platformer; although the city in<i> Halo 3: ODST</i> will be fairly large, its design and structure is not to be compared with that of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/liberty-city/95-15/\">                                         Liberty City</a> from <i><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/grand-theft-auto-iii/61-3724/\"> </a></i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i>Grand Theft Auto III</i> or other traditional sandbox-style <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/open-world/92-207/\">                                         open world games</a>.&nbsp; Even though the scale may not be the same, the impact the city's look has and the time difference between flashback sequences and the rookie's current situation are big parts of the game.&nbsp; Because the Rookie is shorter than the Master Chief's towering 7' height, all enemies and vehicles will seem slightly larger. The <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/heads-up-display/92-180/\">                                         heads-up display</a> will be different from previous games since the player views the world from inside a standard-issue ODST helmet instead of a suit of <a href=\"../../mjolnir-armor/93-33/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                                         Mjolnir armor</a>,<br /><br />In addition to the new progression method, players will have some new tools at their fingertips:<br /> <ul class=\"plain-list\"> <li>ODSTs have access to a silenced M7 SMG and a silenced magnum pistol, allowing them to move about the city surreptitiously. Both of these new weapons have distance scopes.<br /></li> <li>ODSTs have access to VISR Mode, a kind of night vision that outlines friendlies, hostiles, and points-of-interest in glowing neon.</li> <li>ODSTs have access to a PDA, which can provide them a 3D map of the city at all times, and allows them to set personal waypoints.</li></ul><br />However, with the switch to a non-Spartan protagonist, some abilities that were previously Halo staples are now gone:<br /> <ul class=\"plain-list\"> <li>ODSTs do not have a motion tracker.</li> <li>ODSTs use stamina rather than shields and must use <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/first-aid-kit/93-1285/\">                                         medkits</a> to heal their injuries.<br /></li> <li>ODSTs are slower, shorter, and less agile than the Master Chief.</li> <li>ODSTs cannot dual-wield weapons.</li> <li>ODSTs are unable to throw grenades as far as Master Chief.<br /></li></ul>&nbsp; <br /> <h2>FireFight</h2>Firefight is a survival mode that resembles the horde mode in <a href=\"/gears-of-war-2/61-20662/\">          Gears Of War 2</a>. <br />FireFight mode has a total of 10 maps; these maps are as follows: <br /> <ul class=\"plain-list\"> <li>Crater</li> <li>Lost Platoon</li> <li>Rally Point</li> <li>Security Zone</li> <li>Alpha Site</li> <li>Windward</li> <li>Chasm Ten</li> <li>Last Exit</li> <li>Crater (Night)</li> <li>Rally (Night)</li></ul><br />FireFight mode utilizes the unlockable skulls found in Halo 3, so they do not need to be unlocked in ODST. As you move through the waves of a FireFight match, more skulls will automatically turn on.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />At launch, FireFight mode does not feature a matchmaking option for online play, meaning players can only play via system link or online via friend's lists <br />&nbsp;<br />Firefight has no matchmaking system,Instead you will need to play via system link or friend's list. <br /><br />&nbsp;  <h2>Multiplayer  <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"838849\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/1/13797/838849-131140_f260_super.jpg\" title=\"Recon Armor\"><img id=\"838849\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/1/13797/838849-131140_f260_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Recon Armor\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption p-4\">Recon Armor</div></div></div></div></h2><i>Halo 3: ODST</i>'s online multiplayer is exactly identical to that of <i>Halo 3</i>.

After many rumors and speculation as to what the mysterious Vidmaster achievements would reward players with, Bungie confirmed in an article with Game Informer that players who achieve all of the seven Vidmaster achievements will be rewarded the Recon armor permutation. All of the multiplayer maps from the Halo 3 disc and all three DLC packs will be included on the <i>ODST</i> disc, as well as three new maps: Heretic, Longshore, and Citadel.

Due to the asymmetrical geometry of the map, one-sided gametypes such as 1-Flag or 1-Bomb Assault are ideal. <br /><br /> <h3>Heretic </h3><br /> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1140486\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/5758/1140486-h3_heretic01_super.jpg\" title=\"&nbsp;Heretic\"><img id=\"1140486\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/5758/1140486-h3_heretic01_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"&nbsp;Heretic\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption p-4\">&nbsp;Heretic</div></div></div></div>A remake of the classic <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/halo-2/61-7110/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                                         Halo 2</a> map <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/midship/95-1997/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                                         Midship</a>, set within the bowels of the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/the-covenant/92-81/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                                         Covenant</a> ship <i>Pious Inquisitor</i>. Heretic is a nearly perfect re-creation of Midship in terms of actual geometry and design, but the aesthetic appearance of the map has been given a large upgrade to take advantage of the new Halo 3 engine. Dedicated Midship fans from Halo 2 will be happy to find some classic elements from the map have been faithfully carried over to Heretic, including the ability to reach \"P3\" at the top of Pink Tower. Also, players spawn with <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/plasma-grenade/93-103/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                                         Plasma Grenades</a> by default (instead of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/m9-fragmentation-grenade/93-1222/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                                         Frag Grenades</a>) just like in Halo 2. Heretic, being a re-make, is suited for all of the same gametypes as Midship -- small team games of 2v2 or 4v4 work well, as do Free-For-All gametypes. <br />&nbsp; <br /><b> <h2>Similarities to Firefly</h2></b>The majority of the main characters in <i>Halo 3: ODST</i> are voiced by the cast members of Firefly a television program that was aired on Fox back in 2002. <br />&nbsp;<br />Nathan Fillion voices <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/buck/94-11074/\">                                         Edward Buck</a>, Alan Tudyk voices<a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/mickey/94-11076/\">                                          Michael Crespo</a> and Adam Baldwin voices <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/dutch/94-11078/\">                                         Taylor Miles</a>. All of these characters show striking similarities to the characters that these actors played on the television show Firefly. Such as personality traits and back story.<br />&nbsp;<br />Such as Nathan Fillion's character <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/buck/94-11074/\">                                         Edward Buck</a> for example. Nathan Fillion describes his character in a interview saying that he is \"a bit hardened and a bit cranky \", that is a dead on description of the character he played in Firefly.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /> <h2>The Score&nbsp;</h2>The Musical Score was once again composed by <a href=\"/martin-odonnell/72-1741/\">                             Martin (Marty) O'Donnell</a>, however it has a very unique sound. The game abandons the previous halo themes almost completely, there is no choral music.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />The Music is a quieter more jazz-influenced sound. The \"smoky jazz\", as it's referred to, can be heard during The Rookie segments of the game as he investigates <a href=\"/new-mombasa/95-12/\">                           New Mombasa</a> at night.<br />&nbsp;<br />O'Donnell said that since the game tells \"a human story, not a cyborg story (The score should be) \"more intimate and personal. Two of the game's three hours of music are packaged in a two disc soundtrack releasing September 22nd. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Most of the music was recorded in the late winter and spring of 2009. Orchestra sessions were led by <a href=\"/stan-lepard/72-33143/\">                            Stan LePard</a> and performed by the Northwest Sinfonia, at studio X in Washington State. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<h3>ODST Soundtrack </h3>&nbsp;<br /><b>Disc 1: </b><br />&nbsp; <br />01.

The Special Edition contains no extra game content and has the same boxart, but instead comes with an exclusive <i>Halo 3: ODST-</i>styled controller. Along with the special edition, as a bonus, if you pre-order the game from selected retailers, you unlock <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/sergeant-major-avery-junior-johnson/94-964/\">                                         Sgt. Johnson</a> as a playable character in Firefight mode. <br /><b><br /></b> <h2>Development and Announcement<br /></h2><i>Halo 3: ODST</i> began development and production only a few months before its official unveiling at Tokyo Games Show 2008 where it was unveiled under the more pleasing, but less explanatory title <i>Halo 3: Recon</i>. <i>ODST </i>was finished in approximately a year and a half, as opposed to the three-year development cycle that characterized previous <i>Halo </i>titles. According to <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/brian-jarrard/72-51874/\">                                         Brian Jarrard</a>, <i>Halo 3: ODST</i> is slightly smaller in scale than Bungie's usual products, due to the fact that it wasn't intended to be a full game.&nbsp; It started out mostly as an expansion but grew into a full scale game as time went on.&nbsp; After <i>Halo 3</i>, Bungie had several concepts for expanding the <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/halo/62-2/\">                                         Halo universe</a> past the story of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/master-chief/94-175/\">                                         Master Chief</a>, one of which was to play as an ordinary soldier in a slightly darker, grittier setting. Bungie self-admits that it is \"a risk\" to step away from the Master Chief, but they felt that they could do so in an expansion. This concept was eventually settled on and became <i>Halo 3: ODST</i>, which, while not a true sequel, Bungie compares to traditional expansion packs like <i><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/warcraft-iii-the-frozen-throne/61-14073/\"> </a></i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/warcraft-iii-the-frozen-throne/61-14073/\"> <i>Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne</i></a> in terms of content and changes from the original. Because of the inclusion of the full <i>Halo 3</i> multiplayer (including all map packs) and Forge, as well as the new Firefight mode, <i>ODST </i>will go for the full title price of $60.<br /><br /> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"732006\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/118/732006-superintendant_super.jpg\" title=\"An image similar to the ones featured during the Superintendant promotional campaign.\"><img id=\"732006\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/118/732006-superintendant_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"An image similar to the ones featured during the Superintendant promotional campaign.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption p-4\">An image similar to the ones featured during the Superintendant promotional campaign.</div></div></div></div><i>ODST</i> has proven to be a contested subject among Microsoft and Bungie before. In the days leading up to E3 2008, Bungie promised a \"big reveal\" to their fans by running a small-scale alternate reality game on the Bungie.net website and forums featuring \"the Superintendant\", a small, cartoonish figure holding a plunger, who was later revealed to be the municipal A.I. of New Mombasa, who will figure prominently into the story of <i>ODST.</i> In addition to cryptic news and forum posts, roughly a week before E3 2008, a countdown timer appeared on Bungie.net's homepage, superimposed over an image of the Superintendant. The countdown clock was supposed to end during the Microsoft press conference, but a day before E3 a message appeared from studio head <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/harold-ryan/72-9800/\">                                         Harold Ryan</a> apologizing to fans, saying that their announcement was canceled due to their publisher pulling the plug on them. This is highly speculated to be because Microsoft had secured <i><a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy-xiii/61-20664/\"> </a></i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i>Final Fantasy XIII</i> for the Xbox 360, and they did not want two big announcements in the same press conference. Bungie was quite incensed about the cancellation of their announcement, and no further information was had until September 25th, 2008, the one-year anniversary of <i>Halo 3</i>'s release.<br /><br />A teaser trailer was released on Bungie's website, hinting at the involvement of orbital drop shock troopers and a setting in New Mombasa. A date was found in this trailer of January 20th, 2009, which many speculated to be the release date of the new project. This has been since proven false, and the date was either a deliberate red herring or something yet unknown. Speculation ran rampant until Microsoft's press conference at Tokyo Game Show 2008, where an extended version of the teaser trailer was unveiled, and the project was officially announced as <i>Halo 3: Recon</i>, with details provided.<br /><br /> <h3>Name Change</h3>After the unveiling at TGS 08, Bungie released only a small amount of information on <i>Recon</i>. The December issue of Game Informer ran a cover story on <i>Halo 3: Recon</i>, further detailing the game. However, on November 25th, 2008, Bungie suddenly put a release up on their website saying that <i>Halo 3: Recon </i>had been renamed to \"<i>Halo 3: ODST</i>\", along with assets for the game being updated. According to Bungie,<br /> <blockquote> <p>\"This new title is a more straightforward account of the experience that awaits and the role you will assume as you explore the streets of New Mombasa.\"</p></blockquote>Bungie has stated that the<i> Halo 3: ODST </i>expansion will be the last element in the Halo trilogy that they are developing, although being technically the fifth game in the <i>Halo </i>series, Bungie's language does seem somewhat notable. The exact statement from the October 10, 2008 Weekly Update is:  <blockquote> <p>\"We're not ready to discuss the other projects underway within the studio right now but Halo 3 : Recon does represent the final basket of goodness that we will be delivering for the Halo trilogy.&nbsp; There are no more offshoots or side stories in the works.\" </p></blockquote>With the announcement of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/halo-reach/61-26786/\"> <i>Halo: Reach</i></a>, it is clear that Bungie meant <i>ODST</i> would be the last game in the time frame of <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/halo-combat-evolved/61-2600/\"> <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i></a> through <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/halo-3/61-9993/\"> <i>Halo 3</i> </a>they would be developing, with Reach being a prequel to the original <i>Halo</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /> <h2>Advertising Campaign&nbsp;</h2>&nbsp;<br />Prior to the release of ODST, Bungie created a short film featuring the story of one particular trooper. The film was split up into smaller pieces that were then used as short commercials for the game online or on television.The clip begins at a funeral, which is followed by a flashback detailing the exploits of the trooper, named Tarkov. The video moves on to boot camp, where Tarkov gets his hair cut and is forced to crawl through mud while being screamed at in what seems to be Hungarian.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />The clip then moves forward to the Tarkov dropping in from above, and landing in a war zone. After running through a realistic representation of a battle in the Halo universe, Tarkov fights a brute and receives several gashes in his face. The movie then flashes forward to an older Tarkov, performing a funeral service for a fallen trooper, and proceeding to move out in formation with the rest of the squad.<b>&nbsp;<br /></b><br /><h2>Xbox 360 Install Size </h2>&nbsp;Installing Halo 3 ODST on your hard drive takes up about 3.5 GB of space.
